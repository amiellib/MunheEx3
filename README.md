# packman   (task_3)
This project is to make a map and let the packman to go and it all his fruits in the shorts time 


# Getting Started

There is a Test Junit class that can run test program, of course it can be adjusted if needed.
You can use your own map but you can use the arial map
You will also want to download to your own computer google earth.

# Description 
This program gets or builds a map with packmans and fruits and running the program will calculate a route for the packmans to go to eat all the fruits, we could add saving and loading fully ready maps, and the paths can also be viewed in a kml file(google earth).
We have 8 packages to make the packman game,we used Point3D to crate the GPS places of the game.
algorithms is the package where all calculations are done, hence many other classes use this package.
entities is a package where all the entities are defined(packman,ftuit,map,path,game).
